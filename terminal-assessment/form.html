<!--
    action - This defines where the data from the form should be sent to when the button is clicked. It can 
    be sent to various things from a php file to a java servlet.

    method - defines how the form sends the data, whether it is in a GET or POST method to send in the http 
    request. Using GET puts the parameters in the URL while POST does not so it should be used for passwords
-->

<!--
    Get - Get should be used when passing non sensitive data because it is faster and cacheable. The data is 
    sent in the URL and it can be bookmarked so that the user can save that exact data. It is also less safe 
    because of this. Get has a data length cap so its more suitable to small pieces of information

    Post - Post is the more secure way of sending data, the data does not appear in the URL, should be used when 
    passing sensitive data. While Get has a max data length Post does not so it can used to send large amounts of 
    data. Post cannot be bookmarked or cached which also makes it  more sequre than Get.
-->

<!-- 
    POST - submits the current item / resource to the destination replacing the target. Updating a row in a database.
    or changing a file on the other end.
    DELETE - this deletes the item on the other-end be it a file or a row in a database.

<!--
    example/person/name

    First the servlet will try to find an exact match on the servlet based on all charachter in the
    URL. It will choose the longest match eg. example/person/name over example/name/

    If a file extension is provided the servlet will attempt to file the corresponding file and 
    redirect the user there.

    url mapping is defined in the web.xml file in java. This defines the root, servlet name and
    servlet class.
    
    If the servlet can not match to any mapping it will resort to a default if it is set or
    fail.

    Hidden data fields are generally used to pass data to the controller that 
    should not be changeable and needed to identify the database row or customer
    object that needs to be updated or changed. They can be passed from form to form 
    without the customer being able to see it.

    HTTPsession - this is used to store data in a session. This data then persists from one 
    page to the next and can be accessed anywhere. They have an expiry time unlike cookies so that
    the data get deleted after the alloted time. Its useful to check whether a user is still signed in 
    and doesnt need to re enter login details

    Cookie - It is essentially a text value passed in http responses. It is stored like a name value pair 
    like in json. It will persist until it is set to expire just like a session. They are stored in the 
    web browser, make using hidden input fields pointless because the information can just be stored in a 
    cookie.

Application scope - used to store variables that will be needed across all pages of the application.
Page scope - This is the scope of the current page only, used to store variables needed only on this page.
Request scope - Only lasts as long as the current request.
